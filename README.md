# Welcome

So, you've decided to try Codefresh? Welcome on board!

Using this repository we'll help you get up to speed with basic functionality such as: *building Docker images*.

This project uses `Node JS` to build an application which will eventually become a distributable Docker image.

## Looking around

In the root of this repository you'll find a file named `codefresh.yml`, this is our [build descriptor](https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml) and it describes the different steps that comprise our process.
Let's quickly review the contents of this file:

### Building

To bake our application into a Docker image we use Codefresh's [Build step](https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/steps#section-build).

The Build is a simplified abstraction over the Docker build command.

```yml
build_image:
    title: Building Image
    type: build
    #Important: rename this image to to a valid repository in your registry. For example: myUserName/vote
    image_name: codefresh/example-dockerfile-inroot
    #Dockerfile location should be relative to the working directory
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

Use the `image_name` field to declare the name of the resulting image (don't forget to change the image owner name from `codefreshdemo` to your own!).

## Using This Example

To use this example:

* Fork this repository to your own [INSERT_SCM_SYSTEM (git, bitbucket)] account.
* Log in to Codefresh using your [INSERT_SCM_SYSTEM (git, bitbucket)] account.
* Click the `Add Service` button.
* Select the forked repository.
* Select the `I have a Codefresh.yml file` option.
* Complete the wizard.
* Rejoice!
